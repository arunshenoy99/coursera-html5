All tags are either block or inline

headings are block tags and have syntax and semantics

<p> is block and must only contain inline tags within it

accesskey is an attribute to activate an element

tabindex is an attribute that specifies the order in which elements come into focus using the Tab button
tabindex="1" has the highest priority

To add an image in the title use
