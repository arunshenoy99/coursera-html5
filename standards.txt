Use the DOM structure

All tags are either block or inline

headings are block tags and have syntax and semantics

<p> is block and must only contain inline tags within it

accesskey is an attribute to activate an element

tabindex is an attribute that specifies the order in which elements come into focus using the Tab button
tabindex="1" has the highest priority

Special entities
< &lt;
> &gt;
copyright &copy;
blank space &nbsp; Browser will ignore blank spaces given in code
cent &cent;
& &amp;

semantics(design)
<header> Navbars, titles, often has <nav> tag
<nav> A section of page that links to other pages or parts within a page, Usually a list of a tags  
<main> has the main body content between header and footer, has all the <div> elements
<footer> copyright, related documents, social media etc usually at the bottom(does not default to bottom)
<figure> has an <img> tag and <figcaption>Additional info about the image</figcaption>
div was used before but is coming to an end
semantic tags help guide users properly on your page

images
width and size can be specified in pixels or %
% changes according to browser size
To add an image in the title use
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="img/lol.png or .icon" wont support gif or jpeg
In alt dont use picture of and graphic of, be accurate, non redundant, its OK to leave alt empty but dont skip it
Always use alt to describe the meaning behind the image not just a plain description of it
https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/ use an alt decision tree for alt text

fonts
use fontawesome.com for icons to decorate the page
<i></i> specifies icon
For links use <a href="example.com" aria-label="Label here"><i fontawesome.com></a>

links
href stands for hyper reference
types of links
    absolute- fully formed url with protocol, domain host and documents, use when linking to a page outside your website
    relative- directory or filename only, use when linking to files within the website, never use C:/ etc
    images- links can be images too 
    embedded - id of an element inside the same html document
use informative text for your links not just click here 
target attribute _self(open in same tab), _blank(open in new tab)

multimedia
<video> can use src or multiple <source> tags
common attributes are height,width, autoplay, loop, controls    
text inside <video></video> is displayed if browser cannot display video
<audio> can use src typically mp3 or wav
common attributes autoplay, controls, loop, buffered, muted, volume
To move to a time we can use in both audio and video src = "filename.ext#t=5,25" ie start at 5sec to 25sec 
#t=1:38:45 start at 1min 38sec 
multimedia must enhance content not cause a distraction

tables
decide on the rows and columns right from the beginning
<table> container tag, use border attribute to define border(but avoid styling)
<tr> are the rows
<th> used for column headings
<td> is the columns, think of it as a cell
combine multiple columns and rows using attributes such as rowspan and columnspan
use <caption> tag inside table for giving text related to table
